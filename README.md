# Yelp-Review-Classification-Model

## Overview

This repository contains the code for a Natural Language Processing (NLP) classification model built to classify Yelp reviews into two categories: 1-star and 5-star reviews. The model is trained on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes historical Yelp data.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is sourced from Kaggle and consists of historical Yelp reviews. The dataset includes features such as review text, star ratings, and other relevant information.

- Dataset: [Yelp Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- TensorFlow (or any other preferred deep learning library)

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/yelp-review-classification.git
cd yelp-review-classification
```

2. Install the required dependencies as mentioned in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section.

## Usage

To use the pre-trained model for classification, you can run the following command:

```bash
python predict.py "Your review text goes here."
```

Replace "Your review text goes here." with the actual text you want to classify.

## Model Training

If you want to train the model from scratch or fine-tune it on a different dataset, you can use the provided Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Model_Training.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and save the model.

## Results

The model achieves [insert accuracy/precision/recall/F1-score] on the test set. For more details, refer to the evaluation metrics in the notebook or script used for training.
